Differences between Low Fidelity and high Fidelity wireframes :
 Low fidelity is the most basic type of wireframing. Itâ€™s so simplistic, 
that paper and pen will still suffice as a way to represent your ideas, however, creating your wireframes 
in Figma will allow you to easily share them and make sure your team has access to your latest thinking as you iterate. 
Low fidelity wireframes are done in grayscale with a focus on layout and high-level interactions. 
UI elements and content are represented by basic shapes like squares, triangles, circles, and lines 
High fidelity wireframing takes what you put together in the low fidelity stage and sprinkles in more of the detailed elements. 
High fidelity wireframes include visual markers and branding signifiers like colors, graphics, and font style. UI elements look realistic 
and might even include textures and shadows. At this stage, a designer might also choose to add in images and copy. This wireframing kit 
will get you started with all the basics you need to create great looking high fidelity wireframes.
